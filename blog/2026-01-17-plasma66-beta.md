KDE has [released](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.5.90/) its next version of the Plasma desktop as a first beta.

So we are going to join the fun too and today our `beta` stream is again activated and will be housing the Plasma 6.6 Betas.

We will be keeping these building daily until Plasma 6.6 hits the Fedora stable repos later next month.

These builds won't be containing the new [Plasma Login Manager](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-login-manager), [Plasma Setup](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-setup) (formerly Kiss) or [Plasma Keyboard](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-keyboard).

Other Plasma 6.6 important features are highlighted in [KDE Community Wiki](https://community.kde.org/Plasma/Plasma_6#Plasma_6.6).

## Help test the release

If you are interested on testing the latest Plasma release before it hits stable next month, you can just rebase to the beta builds:

`sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/aurora:beta`

or if you want the -dx release:

`sudo bootc switch --enforce-container-sigpolicy ghcr.io/ublue-os/aurora-dx:beta`
