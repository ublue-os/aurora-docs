Hello Stargazers, today we look back at the year 2025 for Aurora and also check in to year 2026. This article will contain most of the same material as the [Bluefin Year End Wrapup](https://link-here) with some Aurora-specific updates added.

This article is going to be on the longer side, so grab your favorite drink and let's get on with it!

## 2025 in General

For 2025, most of our work has been on the "backend" doing lots of refactoring and cleanup on the images. We considered Aurora mostly "feature complete" and didn't ship too many user-facing changes.

## Architecture Overview

As mentioned, we are currently refactoring how our images are made. We have been working with our [Bluefin friends](https://projectbluefin.io) to streamline our builds. At some point, we noticed that we are mostly 1:1 in features, so why spend time duplicating every feature in both codebases.

Aurora and Bluefin are combinations of a set of configuration OCI containers which are then shipped on different images. Originally, the Aurora repository had everything we needed and was a result of organic growth.

We want to share as much of the general code with [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io) and [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg) as possible. We share many things and we wanted a cleaner way to do this. So the new architecture looks like this:

### OCI Containers

We refactored a large amount of our packaging to ship as OCI containers instead of rpms. This moves us away from classic distribution packaging and towards a more cloud native approach.

- [@get-aurora-dev/common](https://github.com/get-aurora-dev/common) - Aurora specific things live here
- [@projectbluefin/common](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common) - Most of the opinions on distro experience is here
  - `ujust`, MOTD, service units, CLI configuration, application choices, etc. Most things that have to do with the workload should live in this repo
  - We share this with Bluefin, so we can have the shared things in one central repo
- [@ublue-os/artwork](https://github.com/ublue-os/artwork) - Art assets repository, shared with Aurora and Bazzite
- [@ublue-os/brew](https://github.com/ublue-os/brew) and associated [@ublue-os/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/ublue-os/homebrew-tap)
  - these provide Homebrew itself and our selection of custom brew packages. Thanks to those of you who have been helping homebrew be better on Linux, it's **amazing**!

These containers have the advantage of making consumption by other bootc projects trivial and are (mostly) distribution agnostic. Custom images now have a granular option to pick and choose the components they want to ship instead of dealing with one monolithic experience. The common repository is structured to be extensible; check out our [Containerfile](https://github.com/get-aurora-dev/common/blob/main/Containerfile) to get a flavor of how things are shipped. This allows the team to keep configuration centralized while providing customization points for downstream projects.

### A Streamlined, Maintainable Set of Images

Decoupling the images this way allows us a more streamlined development experience. It has already enabled us to delete a bunch of duplicated code and makes maintenance easier for the team, while allowing a simpler path for people to contribute and reconcile parity issues between the images. Maintaining Aurora happens in the common OCI layers and not as much in the image repositories.

This also gave us the opportunity to clean up a bunch of old justfiles and scripts that have not been looked at for _years_. We have been taking a less-is-more approach by shipping less customizations as `ujust` recipes.

Thanks for your patience with this transition. It did take longer than expected but we took our time because we're focusing on long-term maintenance.

## Discord Server

As Aurora and our sister projects Bluefin and Bazzite have grown, we have seen a huge uptick of users in our combined Universal Blue Discord server and things started to feel a little crowded. After discussing with our Bazzite friends, we decided a reorganization was in order and we now we have our own [Aurora Discord Server](https://discord.getaurora.dev). The original server has been rebranded as the Bazzite server, but all of the Universal Blue development channels will still remain the place for collaboration across all of the Universal Blue projects.

So if you are interested chatting about Linux and specifically Aurora stuff, please join us @ https://discord.getaurora.dev

## Looking Forward In 2026

### Release Channels

Our images will still be based on Fedora, but we are looking into a CoreOS-inspired workflow for "releases". For what this could look like, check out [Bluefin's post](https://docs.projectbluefin.io/blog/unifying-bluefin) for an in depth discussion. Our current thinking is that the `:stable` stream would stay as it is, but we will add a `:testing` and `:next` stream, similar to CoreOS.

#### Changes and Rationale

At first this looks like a rename, so let's go over the changes:

- `aurora:next` - all changes will land here first. We make no stability guarantees. It will build daily. This will not replace `aurora:latest` because we will for sure break things in here. This will build at least daily and every time a change lands
- `aurora:testing` - When changes in `:next` have been tested by at least one person they queue up to land in testing. We anticipate things to sit in here for a week or two at a minimum unless we need to fix a regression. This builds daily.
- `aurora:stable` - This is effectively the current version of Fedora, except all changes going into this will have at least be vetted by the previous branches.

We do NOT have this promotion process today. This is the goal. If you are on `aurora:latest` we will point you to `aurora:stable-daily` so that you are still getting daily builds. We purposely are not moving you to `next` because that will be volatile. Both the `next` and `testing` branches will be opt in.

So that is the plan. But we don't currently have any set date when (and if) this would be happening. Unfortunately we are a small team and we cannot commit to specific dates at the moment. Currently, we are targeting around the F44 release cycle or after.

### What about the LTS?

Do you remember the Aurora LTS version from way back? Well unfortunately that never happened because of technical hurdles. And once again, our resources were very limited and the current team at that time didn't have the time or "need" to actually create and maintain LTS version of Aurora.

Recently, friend of the project [James](https://github.com/hanthor) has been tinkering with the idea and has a working version of Aurora LTS based on CentOS, just like Bluefin LTS. We won't make any promises how this will pan out in the end, but hopefully we can at some point release it to live next to the current Fedora based images.

### Bazaar Takes Over With F44

With Fedora 44 coming up in Spring 2026 there will be a change regarding our application stores. We have allowed the use of Discover as a replacement but starting with F44, it is time to let it go and make Bazaar the only Flatpak store on Aurora.

Bazaar has seen great amount of development and we have a great relationship with the development team. Now that Aurora is using the Flatpak version of Bazaar (which is the only official version), we will get improvements and bugfixes immediately after they are released on Flathub instead of manually needing to sync and maintain our own rpm versions.

## Developer Experience

In 2026 we will be also looking into incorporating `aurora-dx` features without the need for a separate image and give you more flexibility moving forward:

- Our plan is to add `containerd` to the image, which will also bring in Docker so everything works out of the box, there will not be a need to do the adduser mumbo jumbo; we'll take care of that for you.
- How we'll accomplish this transition is still a bit up in the air, so consider this one a slow burn.

### Curated Experiences

We are putting in effort to have less stuff baked into the images and instead provide curated experiences through Bazaar for Flatpaks and [Bold Brew](https://github.com/Valkyrie00/bold-brew) for command-line apps. Shout out to Vito Castellano for continuing to improve the Linux brew experience with Bold Brew!

![image](https://hackmd.io/_uploads/HkhtPf1Vbg.png)

The first category of curated experiences is our [`ide`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/blob/main/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/ide.Brewfile) offerings, which provides a selection of VSCode, Codium, and Jetbrains toolbox for graphical IDEs, as well as `nvim`, `helix`, and `micro` for you CLI nerds.

The [`experimental-ide`](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/blob/main/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/experimental-ide.Brewfile) selection includes the individual JetBrains products if you prefer to install those one-by-one, as well as [Antigravity](https://antigravity.google/) and [Cursor](https://cursor.com/). These will be promoted to the production tap as we get more feedback. We've also started to add [Swift tools] into the list so that we can tap into this exciting open source community!

Thanks to the new [Flatpak support in Brewfiles](https://docs.getaurora.dev/blog/consolidation) we can ship all sorts of combinations now!

And finally, thanks to our [custom tap](<[@ublue-os/homebrew-tap](https://github.com/ublue-os/homebrew-tap)>) we are investigating on how to bring `bluefin-cli` to MacOS, so that you can have these same convenience tools on multiple operating systems. James [has a prototype](https://github.com/hanthor/bluefin-cli) that you can check out.

### AI/Machine Learning Tools

Our [AI Toolset](https://github.com/projectbluefin/common/blob/main/system_files/shared/usr/share/ublue-os/homebrew/ai-tools.Brewfile) continues to expand. I'd like to highlight [goose](https://block.github.io/goose/) as a tool that I have been really digging into lately. Its donation to the [Agentic AI Foundation](https://www.linuxfoundation.org/press/linux-foundation-announces-the-formation-of-the-agentic-ai-foundation) makes this a great choice for your local LLM/CLI needs.

We've also added [Codex](https://developers.openai.com/codex/cli/), [Copilot CLI](https://github.com/features/copilot/cli), [Gemini](https://github.com/google-gemini/gemini-cli), [LM Studio](https://lmstudio.ai/), [Mistral Vibe](https://github.com/mistralai/mistral-vibe) and [Qwen Code](https://qwenlm.github.io/qwen-code-docs/) to the list. Please continue to send us feedback on the tools you use.

::: info [Thanks Docker!]

You'll find the new [Docker model plugin](https://www.docker.com/blog/docker-model-runner-universal-blue/) included too. Huge shoutout to the folks at Docker for working with us!

## Other Goodies

And here's the stuff that doesn't fit anywhere else in this report!

- Powerwash is here! - `ujust powerwash` is now in alpha and ready for testing - use this command if you want to blow away the data on your PC for donation. This wraps the `bootc install reset --experimental` command for convenience behind some confirmation dialogs. Be careful with this one! Check the [bootc documentation](https://bootc-dev.github.io/bootc/experimental-install-reset.html) for more info

## Metrics

On to the numbers! First off let's look at our critical upstreams. This level of growth confirms our decision to trust in systems that prioritize application developers.

- [Flathub 2025 year in review](https://flathub.org/en/year-in-review/2025) - 20.3% Year over Year Growth, and [Bazaar] continues to get better all the time.
- [Homebrew Yearly Statistics](https://formulae.brew.sh/analytics/os-version/365d/) - Bluefin (#11), Bazzite (#12), and Aurora (#15) have a strong showing in homebrew usage

Aurora metrics can be found from [LFX Insights](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/) which we started using this year. Here is our [contributor metrics](https://insights.linuxfoundation.org/project/aurora/contributors) and some charts. We have also crossed the 2k weekly users milestone.
