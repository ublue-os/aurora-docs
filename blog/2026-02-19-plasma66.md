KDE has [released](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.6.0/) Plasma 6.6, its next version of the Plasma desktop.

<!-- truncate -->

We have also released a new stable build for Aurora, which includes the new Plasma 6.6 update.

For us the bigger things that are included in Plasma 6.6 will be coming with Fedora 44 release. With Fedora44 release we will say goodbye to SDDM and we will switch to use the new [Plasma Login Manager](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-login-manager).

Also with Fedora 44 we will also get the new [Plasma Setup](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-setup) (formerly Kiss) for the after install setup.
