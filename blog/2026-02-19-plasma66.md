KDE has [released](https://kde.org/announcements/plasma/6/6.6.0/) Plasma 6.6, its next version of the Plasma desktop.

<!-- truncate -->

We have also released a new stable build for Aurora, which includes the new Plasma 6.6 update.

For us the bigger things that are included in Plasma 6.6 will be coming with the Fedora 44 release. With that we will say goodbye to SDDM and we will switch to the new [Plasma Login Manager](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-login-manager).

There are still [issues](https://pagure.io/fedora-kde/SIG/issue/684) to iron out on the Fedora side so any help would be welcome.

Also with Fedora 44 we will also get the new [Plasma Setup](https://invent.kde.org/plasma/plasma-setup) (formerly Kiss) for the after install setup.
