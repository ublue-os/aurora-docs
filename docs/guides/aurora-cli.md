title: Aurora CLI
description: A quick Aurora CLI Tutorial
---

Aurora CLI is a opt-in containerized command line experience with many modern terminal tools included. It can be turned on and off, depending on your usecase and preferred command line experience.

To enable this command line experience, run `ujust aurora-cli`. We will add more utilities and tweak this experience over time.

Rerun the `ujust` from above to obtain the newest tools added to in an update.
