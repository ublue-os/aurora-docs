## Aurora

**The ultimate productivity workstation for everyone is here**.

Aurora combines the familiar windows-like KDE Desktop Interface with robustness and unparalleled ease of use. It is intended to be maintenance-free, reliable, fast, and easy to use. The golden age of the Linux Desktop is here.

## Features

**This image heavily utilizes _cloud-native concepts_.**

System updates are image-based and automatic. Applications are logically separated from the system by using Flatpaks for graphical applications and `brew` for command line applications. Workloads for development are containerized.

## How is this different from a traditional Linux Desktop?

- Aurora takes a [greenfield approach](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greenfield_project) to Linux applications by defaulting to Flathub and `brew`.
- Aurora recommends using containerized tools - it focuses on [Devcontainers](https://containers.dev) for declarative containerized development. You can use Podman or Docker to run and bootstrap your containers.
- Aurora _tries_ to remove the need for the user to use `rpm-ostree` or `bootc` directly
- Aurora focuses on automation of OS services and upgrades instead of user interaction. Upgrades are automatic and silent, so you never have to think about it again.

## Starship is not for me, how do I disable it?

You can remove or comment the line below in `/etc/bashrc` to restore the default prompt.

```bash
eval "$(starship init bash)"
```
