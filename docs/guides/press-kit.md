Thank you for engaging and generating content about Aurora and Universal-Blue, it means a lot!

Explanation of how to use the branding and terminology for the Aurora project is detailed down below.

## Terminology

The project is known as `Aurora` and there are no abbreviations of it.

Aurora is built with and on [Universal Blue](https://universal-blue.org), which publishes the base images that it uses. These in turn are derived from [Fedora's Kinoite](https://fedoraproject.org/atomic-desktops/kinoite/) images. Universal Blue also builds other similar images including [Bluefin](https://projectbluefin.io), [Bazzite](https://bazzite.gg), and [uCore](https://projectucore.io). It also acts as the GitHub organization for all of these projects including Aurora.

### Proper Usage

- Aurora: Used to refer to this project and the operating system.
- Aurora DX: Used to refer to the "Developer Experience (-DX)" edition of Aurora.
- Aurora Helium LTS: this is used to refer to the Long Term Support Release of Aurora.

### Improper Usage

- AuroraOS - or any addition of "OS" to the name
- Fedora Aurora - we are not directly related to Fedora and this name implies that. Checkout the [Mission Document](https://universal-blue.org/mission.html) from Universal Blue.
- Universal Blue Aurora or uBlue Aurora - "Bluefin is built with Universal Blue" or "Bluefin is a Universal Blue image" is recommended instead.
- "Immutable Distribution" - Aurora is an operating system, it is neither immutable nor a distribution, it is a custom image based on Fedora or CentOS, depending on the edition.

This is the main logo of the project, there is also a white variant available and a version with text near the main logo.

The white variant of the logo is available here: [White Aurora Logo](/img/aurora-v3-white.svg).

And the white variant of the text logo is available here: [White Text Logo](/img/aurora-text-logo-v4-white.svg)

These logos were made by the fantastic @adelia.svg (on Discord) and I can't thank her enough for them, they are amazing!

The main wallpaper used in all Aurora variants is this one, created by [Riveting Renders](https://www.etsy.com/shop/RivetingRenders).
